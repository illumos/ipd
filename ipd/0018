Illumos port of FreeBSD's HAST (High Available STorage)...

Please reference... https://github.com/stacepellegrino/illumos/tree/master/HAST

This is regarding the port of FreeBSD's HAST (High Available Storage) to Illumos and assoicated distributions, with the scope to extend functionality regarding:

- multi-homed storage with I/O fencing mechanisms using reservations (see https://github.com/jfqd/illumos-omnios/blob/master/usr/src/man/man7i/mhd.7i);
- cluster membership vote counts via a Quorum device/server, therefore eliminating a potential split-brain scenario;
- support for multi-homed stretched clusters up to at least 4-nodes (2-local and 2-remote).

However, RAID-1 over TCP/IP (how HAST has been originally conceived) could provide the basis for a stretched cluster for HA ZFS iSCSI JBOD solutions between sites without a high-bandwidth/low-latency interconnect to provide a multi-site multi-homed storage solution.

The original source code of concern can be found here...

- https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/tree/master/sbin/hastd
- https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/tree/master/sbin/hastctl


Further development should be done with the inclusion of iSCSI shared block-devices, and also support for more nodes than just the current limit of two, therefore adding the capability of a potential stretched cluster configuration.

This development of HAST as proposed could be an underlying layer to the development of HAS-ME (High Available Shared-Memory Entanglement) and zLockstep (the "z" is for zones), part of an overall Illumos HA framework (see [ https://github.com/stacepellegrino/illumos/tree/master/HAS-ME for more information on this HA framework).
