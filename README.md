# illumos Project Discussion

IPDs are a shrink-to-fit description of larger scale (in either code size or
impact) project wishing to make changes to illumos.  They should describe the
what and the why and give people the opportunity to comment on both.

An IPD is at its heart, just a README.md in a numbered directory in this
repository, existing IPDs are enumerated below for easy reference.  Further
information is available at the end of this document.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome.  A good rule of thumb as to whether you _should_
have an IPD is whether you are making a change with high impact to other
developers or users (introducing or removing a supported platform, doing
something with non-obvious compatibility constraints), or engaging in a
long-term project that will likely integrate in pieces, to provide the overall
picture.

For your first contribution, you might want to just submit a pull request to
this repository.  Going forward if this is a thing that you will do again,
we'll probably give you write access to this repository so you can just add
your new IPDs as they come up.

## Format

An IPD has a short header block indicating authorship (that's you),
sponsorship (we'll get to that), and state.

### States

#### predraft

You've started writing your IPD and you want to share it narrowly, or even
just to reserve your a number in this repository.  You're _predraft_, maybe
you only have a title and a short paragraph right now, that's fine.

#### draft

You've finished writing and explaining, and now you're going to send your IPD
to the [developer mailing list](mailto:developer@lists.illumos.org), this is a
draft, you're going to receive feedback so it's not complete, but it's close.

#### published

One or more people from the [illumos core
team](https://illumos.org/docs/about/leadership/) have agreed that what you've
described is a good thing, and that we should do it.  Your IPD is done and
published (though is not immutable! If you find more information would be
useful later, please add it!)

### Sponsorship

"Sponsor" is a weird word here, it's just the person or people on the illumos
core team who were ok with your IPD.  Don't worry about it.
